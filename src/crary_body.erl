%%% @doc This module provides functions for detecting, reading, and
%%% writing HTTP bodies and encodings such as chunking.
%%%
%%% If you try to do chunked writes for a pre-http-1.1 client, this
%%% module will do it by falling back to writing a streamed body with
%%% no `content-length'. Obviously the connection has to be closed to
%%% end the data stream. This means you can using a stream to
%%% incrementally generate a webpage, or write out a large file, and
%%% browsers such as w3m and lynx will still be able to work fine.

%% @doc Does this request have a body that needs to be read? It determins
%% this by checking for `content-length' or `transfer-encoding' headers.
%% @spec has_body(crary:crary_req()) -> bool()
has_body(Req) ->
    crary_headers:has("content-length", Req) orelse

%% @doc Return a new chunk reader.
%% @spec new_reader(crary:crary_req()) -> pid()
new_reader(Req) ->
    gen_server:start_link(?MODULE, init, Req, []).

%% @doc Return a new chunk writer.
%%
%% It may be observed that currently this call just returns the same
%% `Req' that was passed to it. Don't depend on this, it will likely
%% be changed to a pid() or similar in the future for supporting
%% buffering or other encodings.
%% @spec new_writer(crary:crary_req()) -> writer()
%% @see with_writer/2
%% @see crary:r/4
new_writer(Req) ->
    Req.

%% @doc Call `F(Writer)' with a new writer, automatically closing the
%% writer when `F' returns, and writing an error message if `F' throws
%% an exception.
%%
%% Since the response line has almost certainly already been writen
%% out, the best this function can do is append an error message into
%% the output, and hope that it will be seen. If this is not good
%% behavior for your application, use a try/catch form in `F' to keep
%% errors from making it down the stack to here.
%%
%% @spec with_writer(crary:crary_req(), function()) -> pid()

%% @doc Read and return the next available chunk.

%% @doc Read and return the full body. It doesn't matter if the body
%% is chunked or fixed length, this will read it all in and return it
%% as one binary. Probably great for `PUT' bodies for forms. Probably
%% not great for reading in a large amount of data.
